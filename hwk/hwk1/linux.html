                            Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the Linux kernel. 
                            Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both 
                            desktop and server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an 
                            operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux 
                            distributions use the word "Linux" in their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux 
                            to refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux 
                            distributions are not just the Linux kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also 
                            numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project. This has led to 
                            some controversy.

                            Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, 
                            but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Because of 
                            the dominance of the Linux kernel-based Android OS on smartphones, Linux has the largest 
                            installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Linux is also the leading 
                            operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and 
                            the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having before gradually 
                            eliminated all competitors).
