                            Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems 
                            that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 
                            1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, 
                            and others.[3]

                            Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix 
                            to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both 
                            academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University 
                            of California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM (AIX), and Sun 
                            Microsystems (Solaris). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix 
                            to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation 
                            (SCO) in 1995.[4] The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral 
                            industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating 
                            systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS). As of 2014, 
                            the Unix version with the largest installed base is Apple's macOS.[5]

                            Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes 
                            called the "Unix philosophy". This concept entails that the operating 
                            system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited, 
                            well-defined function,[6] with a unified filesystem as the main means 
                            of communication,[3] and a shell scripting and command language to combine 
                            the tools to perform complex workflows. Unix distinguishes itself from its 
                            predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating 
                            system is written in the C programming language, thus allowing Unix to reach 
                            numerous platforms.[7]
