                            Microsoft Windows is a group of several graphical operating system families, 
                            all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Each family caters 
                            to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Windows families include 
                            Windows NT and Windows Embedded; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows 
                            Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include 
                            Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

                            Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, 
                            as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing 
                            interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[5] Microsoft Windows came to 
                            dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, 
                            overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see Windows 
                            as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented 
                            on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's 
                            favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, 
                            in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system 
                            market to Android,[6] because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. 
                            In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices 
                            sold. This comparison however may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems 
                            traditionally target different platforms. Still, numbers for server use of Windows 
                            (that are comparable to competitors) show one third market share, similar to for end user use.
