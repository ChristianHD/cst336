                            macOS  is a series of graphical operating 
                            systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for 
                            Apple's Mac family of computers. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by 
                            web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.

                            macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The first is colloquially 
                            called the "classic" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which 
                            was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, 
                            with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began naming its 
                            releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, 
                            releases have been named after landmarks in California. Apple shortened the name to "OS X" 
                            in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they were using 
                            for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version is macOS High Sierra, 
                            which was publicly released in September 2017.
